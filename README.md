# Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithms

This repository provides an analysis of various optimization algorithms with a focus on multi-objective optimization. Each method includes an introduction, methodology, implementation, conclusion, and bibliography.

## Problem Statement

In datasets where identifying Pareto-optimal points is essential, deterministic algorithms like Simple Cull can be effective. However, as dataset size increases, these algorithms become less efficient due to longer processing times. In such cases, stochastic algorithms offer a viable alternative, often providing near-constant execution times for specific parameters and problems.

## Algorithms Compared

This analysis evaluates several algorithms, including their continuous versions and adaptations for the specified problem:

- **Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)**
- **Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III)**
- **Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2)**
- **Non-dominated Sorting Gravitational Search Algorithm (NSGSA)**
- **Simple Cull Algorithm**
- **Pareto Simulated Annealing (PSA)**
- **Binary Multi-Objective Tabu Search (BMOTS)**
- **Full Non-dominated Sorting and Ranking**

## Repository Structure

- **helpers/**: Contains auxiliary scripts and functions used across various implementations.
